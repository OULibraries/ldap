- add ldap token evaluation to feeds such that multiple attributes can be parsed
- add functionality to populate user->data['ldap_authentication'] and other user populating data
- simpletests
- documenation of use cases
- inclusion of sample feeds as exportables
- deal with multivalued attributes.  this is already built into tokenization and should be resolved from there by
    using token nameing structure there.  see ldap_server_tokenize_entry() function and http://drupal.org/node/1245736
