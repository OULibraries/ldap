# abstract class FeedsPlugin: base class for all plugins
- FeedsFetcher - A plugin responsible for downloading, loading or receiving a feed
- FeedsParser - A plugin responsible for bringing a fetched feed into a normalized format for processors
- FeedsProcessor (don't need to implement) - A plugin that "does stuff" with a parsed feed.
- FeedsSource: holds a source (i. e. a URL or a file path). A FeedsSource object is being passed into FeedsImporter when importing from that source. A FeedsSource can be tied to a specific node or not.
